# Item Carry

This script is used to automatically attach and carry items when using `ox_inventory`. 

## Adding New Entries to CARRY_ITEMS

To add a new entry to the `config` table in `itemCarry/config.lua`, follow the structure provided below:

```lua
local config = {
    ['box'] = {
        walkOnly = true,
        blockVehicle = true,
        anim = {
            dict = 'anim@heists@box_carry@',
            clip = 'idle',
            flag = 51
        },
        prop = {
            bone = 60309,
            model = joaat('hei_prop_heist_box'),
            placement = {
                pos = vector3(0.025000, 0.080000, 0.255000),
                rot = vector3(-145.000000, 290.000000, 0.000000),
            },
        },
    },
}
```

- `walkOnly?`: (`boolean`) weather or not you want the player to only be able to walk while carrying this item.
- `blockVehicle?`: (`boolean`) weather or not you want the player to be able to get in a vehicle with this item.
- `animation`: (`{dict: string, clip: string, flag?: number}`) The name of the animation associated with the item.
- `prop`: (`{bone: number, model: number, placement: {pos: vector3, rot: vector3}}`) prop attachment data for the item being carried
