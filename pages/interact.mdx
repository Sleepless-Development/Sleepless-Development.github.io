# Sleepless Interact

A 3D DUI interaction library for interacting with various entities and points in the world.

<ResourceLinks repo="https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_interact" />

## Installation

### Download a [release](https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_interact/releases) or build the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_interact.git
cd sleepless_interact/web
pnpm i
pnpm build
```

## Usage

To enable the library inside of your resource just add `@demi_interact/init.lua` as a client_script in your `fxmanifest.lua` file.

```lua
client_scripts {
    '@sleepless_interact/init.lua',
}
```

When sleepless_interact has been imported into your script, it will make a new global:
- `interact` for calling sleepless_interact functions into your script.

<Callout type="info">
    all of the functions can also be called via exports. example: `exports.sleepless_interact:addEntity(data)`
</Callout>

You can now use the interact functions inside of your resource.
