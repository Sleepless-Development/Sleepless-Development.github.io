# Sleepless Interact

A 3D DUI interaction library for interacting with various entities and points in the world.

<ResourceLinks repo="https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_interact" />

## Installation

### Download a [release](https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_interact/releases) or build the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_interact.git
cd sleepless_interact/web
pnpm i
pnpm build
```

## Configure

To changed the config settings, look inside `imports/config.lua`

```lua
-- vec4 RGBA (R: 0-255, G: 0-255, B: 0-255, A: 0-255)
config.color = vec4(28, 126, 214, 200)

-- {dict: string, txt: string} non-active sprite dictionary/texture
config.indicatorSprite = { dict = 'shared', txt = 'emptydot_32' }

-- boolean true/false use a keybind to show and hide the interactions
config.useShowKeyBind = false

-- string default key mapping for the show interactions keybind
config.defaultShowKeyBind = 'LMENU'

-- "hold" | "toggle" sets the behavior of the show interactions key bind
config.showKeyBindBehavior = 'hold'
```

## Usage

To enable the library inside of your resource just add `@sleepless_interact/init.lua` as a client_script in your `fxmanifest.lua` file.

```lua
client_scripts {
    '@sleepless_interact/init.lua',
}
```

When sleepless_interact has been imported into your script, it will make a new global:
- `interact` for calling sleepless_interact functions into your script.

<Callout type="info">
    all of the functions can also be called via exports. example: `exports.sleepless_interact:addEntity(data)`
</Callout>

You can now use the interact functions inside of your resource.
