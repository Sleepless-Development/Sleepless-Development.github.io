# addGlobalPed

Registers a global interaction for non-player characters (NPCs) or peds in the game. This function enables customizable interactions with NPCs, allowing for specific actions and conditions to be defined for interacting with these entities across the game world.

## Parameters

- `data` (`PedInteractionData`): A table containing the interaction data. It must include:
  - `id` (`string | number`): A unique identifier for the interaction.
  - `bone?` (`string or string[]`): name of the bone to interact with or an array of bones. will use the first valid bone for the entity from the array
  - `options` (`table`): A list of options for the interaction. Each option is a table with the following fields:
    - `text` (`string`): The text displayed for the option.
    - `icon` (`string`): The simple FontAwesome icon name displayed for the option (e.g., "hand").
    - `groups?` (`table<string, number>`): table of allowed jobs and minimum grades for this Option
    - `items?` (`string or string[] or table<string, number>`): An item, array of items, or pairs of items-count required to show the option.
    - `anyItem?` (`boolean`): Only require a single item from the items table to exist.
    - `destroy?` (`boolean`): when true, the entire interaction will destroy when this option is selected
    - `canInteract?` (`function(entity?: number, distance: number, coords: vector3, id: string | number)`): A function that determines if the option can be interacted with.
    - `action?` (`function(id: string | number, entity?: number, coords: vec3, distance: number)`): function that gets called when the option is selected
    - `export?` (`string`): export that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `event?` (`string`): client event that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `serverEvent?` (`string`): server event that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `command?` (`string`): command that gets called when the option is selected.
  - `offset?` (`vector3`): The offset from the ped's position where the interaction is located.
  - `renderDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction indicator is visible. Defaults to `5.0`.
  - `activeDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction menu is visible. Defaults to `1.0`.
  - `cooldown?` (`number`): The cooldown time in milliseconds between interactions to prevent spamming. Defaults to `1000`.

## Example

```lua
interact.addGlobalPed({
    id = "uniquePedInteractionId",
    options = {
        {
            text = "Interact with NPC",
            icon = "hand",  -- Example simple FA icon name
            groups = {['police'] = 1},
            items = {['money'] = 100},
            action = function(data) print("NPC interaction triggered") end,
            canInteract = function(entity, distance, coords, id)
                return true
            end
        }
    },
    offset = vector3(0, 0, 1.0),
    bone = "head",
    renderDistance = 10.0,
    activeDistance = 2.0,
    cooldown = 1500
})
