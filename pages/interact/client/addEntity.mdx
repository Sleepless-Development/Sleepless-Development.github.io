# addEntity

Registers an interaction for a networked entity in the game. This function enables players to interact with specified networked entities within a defined distance, with customizable options for each interaction.

## Parameters

- `data` (`EntityData`): A table containing the interaction data. It must include:
  - `id` (`string | number`): A unique identifier for the interaction.
  - `netId` (`number`): The network ID for the networked entity.
  - `offset?` (`vector3`): The offset from the entity's position where the interaction is located.
  - `bone?` (`string`): The name of the bone for the entity where the interaction is attached.
  - `options` (`table`): A list of options for the interaction. Each option is a table with the following fields:
    - `text` (`string`): The text displayed for the option.
    - `icon` (`string`): The simple FontAwesome icon name displayed for the option (e.g., "hand").
    - `destroy?` (`boolean`): when true, the entire interaction will destroy when this option is selected
    - `action` (`function(data: EntityInteraction)`): The function to call when the option is selected.
    - `canInteract` (`function(entity?: number, distance: number, coords: vector3, id: string | number)`): A function that determines if the option can be interacted with.
  - `renderDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction indicator is visible. Defaults to `5.0`.
  - `activeDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction menu is visible. Defaults to `1.0`.
  - `cooldown?` (`number`): The cooldown time in milliseconds between interactions to prevent spamming. Defaults to `1000`.

## Returns

- `id` (`string | number`): The unique identifier for the interaction that was added.

## Example

```lua
interact.addEntity({
    id = "uniqueNetworkedEntityId",
    netId = 123456,  -- Example network ID
    options = {
        {
            text = "Networked Interact Option",
            icon = "hand",  -- Example simple FA icon name
            action = function(data) print("Networked entity action triggered") end,
            canInteract = function(entity, distance, coords, id)
                return distance < 2.0 -- Example condition based on distance
            end
        }
    },
    renderDistance = 10.0,
    activeDistance = 2.0,
    cooldown = 1500
})
