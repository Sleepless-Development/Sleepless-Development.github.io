# addGlobalModel

Registers interactions for one or more models in the game. This function enables global interactions with specified models, allowing customizable options for each interaction regardless of the model's specific instances or locations.

## Parameters

- `data` (`ModelData`): A table containing the interaction data. It must include:
  - `id` (`string | number`): A unique identifier for the interaction.
  - `models` (`table`): A list of models and their interaction settings. Each entry in the list is a table with the following fields:
    - `model` (`string | number`): The model name or hash for which the interaction is being registered.
    - `offset?` (`vector3`): The offset from the model's position where the interaction is located.
    - `bone?` (`string or string[]`): name of the bone to interact with or an array of bones. will use the first valid bone for the entity from the array
  - `options` (`table`): A list of options for the interaction. Each option is a table with the following fields:
    - `text` (`string`): The text displayed for the option.
    - `icon` (`string`): The simple FontAwesome icon name displayed for the option (e.g., "hand").
    - `groups?` (`table<string, number>`): table of allowed jobs and minimum grades for this Option
    - `items?` (`string or string[] or table<string, number>`): An item, array of items, or pairs of items-count required to show the option.
    - `anyItem?` (`boolean`): Only require a single item from the items table to exist.
    - `destroy?` (`boolean`): when true, the entire interaction will destroy when this option is selected
    - `canInteract?` (`function(entity?: number, distance: number, coords: vector3, id: string | number)`): A function that determines if the option can be interacted with.
    - `action?` (`function(id: string | number, entity?: number, coords: vec3, distance: number)`): function that gets called when the option is selected
    - `export?` (`string`): export that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `event?` (`string`): client event that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `serverEvent?` (`string`): server event that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `command?` (`string`): command that gets called when the option is selected.
  - `renderDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction indicator is visible. Defaults to `5.0`.
  - `activeDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction menu is visible. Defaults to `1.0`.
  - `cooldown?` (`number`): The cooldown time in milliseconds between interactions to prevent spamming. Defaults to `1000`.

## Example

```lua
interact.addGlobalModel({
    id = "uniqueNetworkedEntityId",
    models = {
        {model = "prop_vend_snak_01", offset = vector3(0, 0, 1.0)},
        {model = "prop_vend_soda_02", offset = vector3(0, 0, 1.0)},
    },
    options = {
        {
            text = "Interact with Model",
            icon = "hand",  -- Example simple FA icon name
            groups = {['police'] = 1},
            items = {['money'] = 100},
            action = function(data) print("Model interaction triggered") end,
            canInteract = function(entity, distance, coords, id)
                return distance < 2.0 -- Example condition based on distance
            end
        }
    },
    renderDistance = 10.0,
    activeDistance = 2.0,
    cooldown = 1500
})
