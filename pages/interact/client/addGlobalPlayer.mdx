# addGlobalPlayer

Registers a global interaction for players in the game. This function enables interactions with players, using customizable options for each interaction that can be triggered based on specified conditions.

## Parameters

- `data` (`PedInteractionData`): A table containing the interaction data. It must include:
  - `id` (`string | number`): A unique identifier for the interaction.
  - `options` (`table`): A list of options and actions for the interaction. Each option is a table with the following fields:
    - `text` (`string`): The text displayed for the option.
    - `icon` (`string`): The simple FontAwesome icon name displayed for the option (e.g., "hand").
    - `groups` (`{['job'] = 1}`): table of allowed jobs and grades for this Option
    - `destroy?` (`boolean`): when true, the entire interaction will destroy when this option is selected
    - `action` (`function(data: EntityInteraction)`): The function to call when the option is selected.
    - `canInteract` (`function(entity?: number, distance: number, coords: vector3, id: string | number): boolean`): A function that determines if the option can be interacted with, accepting parameters for optional entity, distance to the interaction, interaction coordinates, and the interaction ID.
  - `offset?` (`vector3`): The offset from the player's position where the interaction is located.
  - `bone?` (`string`): The name of the bone for the player where the interaction is attached.
  - `renderDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction indicator is visible. Defaults to `5.0`.
  - `activeDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction menu is visible. Defaults to `1.0`.
  - `cooldown?` (`number`): The cooldown time in milliseconds between interactions to prevent spamming. Defaults to `1000`.

## Example

```lua
interact.addGlobalPlayer({
    id = "uniquePlayerInteractionId",
    options = {
        {
            text = "Interact with Player",
            icon = "hand",  -- Example simple FA icon name
            groups = {['police'] = 1},
            action = function(data) print("Player interaction triggered") end,
            canInteract = function(entity, distance, coords, id)
                return distance < 2.0 -- Example condition based on distance
            end
        }
    },
    offset = vector3(0, 0, 1.0),
    bone = "head",
    renderDistance = 10.0,
    activeDistance = 2.0,
    cooldown = 1500
})
