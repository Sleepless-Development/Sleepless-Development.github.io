# addLocalEntity

Registers an interaction for a local (non-networked) entity in the game. This allows players to interact with specified local entities within a defined distance, offering customizable interaction options.

## Parameters

- `data` (`LocalEntityData`): A table containing the interaction data. It must include:
  - `id` (`string | number`): A unique identifier for the interaction.
  - `entity` (`number`): The entity handle of the local entity.
  - `offset?` (`vec3`): The offset from the entity's position where the interaction is located.
  - `bone?` (`string or string[]`): name of the bone to interact with or an array of bones. will use the first valid bone for the entity from the array
  - `options` (`table`): A list of options for the interaction. Each option is a table with the following fields:
    - `label` (`string`): The text displayed for the option.
    - `icon` (`string`): The simple FontAwesome icon name displayed for the option (e.g., "hand").
    - `groups?` (`table<string, number>`): table of allowed jobs and minimum grades for this Option
    - `items?` (`string or string[] or table<string, number>`): An item, array of items, or pairs of items-count required to show the option.
    - `anyItem?` (`boolean`): Only require a single item from the items table to exist.
    - `remove?` (`boolean`): when true, the entire interaction will destroy when this option is selected
    - `canInteract?` (`function(entity?: number, distance: number, coords: vec3, id: string | number)`): A function that determines if the option can be interacted with.
    - `action?` (`function(id: string | number, entity?: number, coords: vec3, distance: number)`): function that gets called when the option is selected
    - `export?` (`string`): export that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `event?` (`string`): client event that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `serverEvent?` (`string`): server event that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `command?` (`string`): command that gets called when the option is selected.
  - `renderDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction indicator is visible. Defaults to `5.0`.
  - `activeDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction menu is visible. Defaults to `1.0`.
  - `cooldown?` (`number`): The cooldown time in milliseconds between interactions to prevent spamming. Defaults to `1000`.
  - `removeWhenDead?` (`boolean`): If this is set to true the interaction will be removed when the entity is dead. if it is a global interation, it will prevent the interaction from being added again while dead
  - `sprite?` (`table`) a table of override data for the indicator sprite (small circle by default in config)
    - `dict?` (`string`) texture dictionary
    - `txt?` (`string`) texture name
    - `color?` (`vec4`) color

## Returns

- `id` (`string | number`): The unique identifier for the interaction that was added.

## Example

```lua
interact.addLocalEntity({
    id = "uniqueLocalEntityId",
    entity = 123456,  -- Example entity handle
    options = {
        {
            label = "Local Interact Option",
            icon = "hand",  -- Example simple FA icon name
            groups = {['police'] = 1},
            items = {['money'] = 100},
            onSelect =function(data) print("Local entity action triggered") end,
            canInteract = function(entity, distance, coords, id)
                return true
            end
        }
    },
    renderDistance = 10.0,
    activeDistance = 2.0,
    cooldown = 1500
})

### export

```lua
    exports.sleepless_interact:addLocalEntity(data)
```
