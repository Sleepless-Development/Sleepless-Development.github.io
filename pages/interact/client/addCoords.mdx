# addCoords

Adds a static coordinates-based interaction to the game. This function registers an interaction at a specific location, allowing players to interact with it when they are within a defined distance.

## Parameters

- `data` (`CoordsData`): A table containing the interaction data. It must include:
  - `id` (`string | number`): A unique identifier for the interaction.
  - `coords` (`vector3 or vector3[]`): The coordinates where the interaction is located.
  - `options` (`table`): A list of options for the interaction. Each option is a table with the following fields:
    - `text` (`string`): The text displayed for the option.
    - `icon` (`string`): The simple FontAwesome icon name displayed for the option (e.g., "hand").
    - `groups?` (`table<string, number>`): table of allowed jobs and minimum grades for this Option
    - `items?` (`string or string[] or table<string, number>`): An item, array of items, or pairs of items-count required to show the option.
    - `anyItem?` (`boolean`): Only require a single item from the items table to exist.
    - `destroy?` (`boolean`): when true, the entire interaction will destroy when this option is selected
    - `canInteract?` (`function(entity?: number, distance: number, coords: vector3, id: string | number)`): A function that determines if the option can be interacted with.
    - `action?` (`function(id: string | number, entity?: number, coords: vec3, distance: number)`): function that gets called when the option is selected
    - `export?` (`string`): export that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `event?` (`string`): client event that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `serverEvent?` (`string`): server event that gets called when the option is selected.
    - `command?` (`string`): command that gets called when the option is selected.
  - `renderDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction indicator is visible. Defaults to `5.0`.
  - `activeDistance?` (`number`): distance at which the interaction menu is visible. Defaults to `1.0`.
  - `cooldown?` (`number`): The cooldown time in milliseconds between interactions to prevent spamming. Defaults to `1000`.

## Returns

- `id` (`string | number`): The unique identifier for the interaction that was added.

## Examples

### single

```lua
interact.addCoords({
    id = "uniqueInteractionId",
    coords = vector3(123.4, 567.8, 250.0),
    options = {
        {
            text = "Interact Option 1",
            icon = "hand",  -- Example simple FA icon name
            groups = {['police'] = 1},
            items = {['money'] = 100},
            action = function(data) print("Action 1 triggered") end,
            canInteract = function(entity, distance, coords, id)
                return distance < 2.0 -- Example condition based on distance
            end
        }
    },
    renderDistance = 10.0,
    activeDistance = 2.0,
    cooldown = 1500
})
```

### multiple

<Callout type="warning">
    when sending a list of coords it will modify the id for eachone by adding the index to the end of the id: "uniqueid:1", "uniqueid:2", etc.
</Callout>

```lua
interact.addCoords({
    id = "uniqueInteractionId", --id that is stored in variable
    coords = {
        vector3(123.4, 567.8, 250.0),
        vector3(421.4, 567.8, 125.0)
    },
    options = {
        {
            text = "Interact Option 1",
            icon = "hand",  -- Example simple FA icon name
            action = function(data) print("Action 1 triggered") end,
            canInteract = function(entity, distance, coords, id)
                return true
            end
        }
    },
    renderDistance = 10.0,
    activeDistance = 2.0,
    cooldown = 1500
})
```
