## Configure

To changed the config settings, look inside `imports/config.lua`

```lua
-- this is the maximum distance that interacts will render the indicator sprite (little cirlce)
-- recommend keeping this pretty low for optimization
config.maxInteractDistance = 5.0

-- {0-255, 0-255, 0-255, 0-255}
config.themeColor = { 28, 100, 184, 200 } --- r, g, b, a

--- texture dictionary and texture name for the sprite used to show non active interactions.
config.IndicatorSprite = { dict = 'shared', txt = 'emptydot_32' }

-- boolean true/false use a keybind to show and hide the interactions
config.useShowKeyBind = true

-- string default key mapping for the show interactions keybind
config.defaultShowKeyBind = 'LMENU'

-- "hold" | "toggle" sets the behavior of the show interactions key bind
config.showKeyBindBehavior = 'toggle'

```
