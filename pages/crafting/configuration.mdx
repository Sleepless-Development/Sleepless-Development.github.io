# Configuration

The main configuration file is located at `config/config.lua`. This file controls general settings for the crafting system.

## General Settings

```lua
local config = {}

config.DEBUG = false              -- Enable debug mode for development

config.inventory = 'ox'           -- Options: 'ox', 'qb'

config.interact = 'drawtext'      -- Options: 'ox_target', 'qb-target', 'sleepless_interact', 'drawtext'

config.UIColor = {                -- RGB colors for UI theme
    primary = { 49, 164, 252 },   -- blue
    secondary = { 218, 165, 32 }, -- gold
    error = { 200, 0, 0 },        -- red
}

config.blockCraftStationStorageTransfer = true -- Prevent players from moving items into crafting station storage

config.versionCheck = true        -- Enable version checking on resource start
```

## Options Explained

### `config.DEBUG`

When set to `true`, enables debug mode which provides additional console output for troubleshooting. Keep this `false` in production.

### `config.inventory`

Specifies which inventory system your server uses:

| Value | Inventory System |
|-------|-----------------|
| `'ox'` | ox_inventory |
| `'qb'` | qb-inventory |

### `config.interact`

Specifies which interaction system to use for interacting with crafting stations:

| Value | Interaction System |
|-------|-------------------|
| `'ox_target'` | ox_target |
| `'qb-target'` | qb-target |
| `'sleepless_interact'` | sleepless_interact |
| `'drawtext'` | Simple drawtext prompt |

### `config.UIColor`

Customize the colors used in the crafting UI. Each color is defined as an RGB array `{ R, G, B }`:

- `primary` - Main accent color used throughout the UI
- `secondary` - Secondary accent color for highlights
- `error` - Color used for error states and messages

### `config.blockCraftStationStorageTransfer`

When set to `true`, players can only take items out of a crafting station's storage, but cannot put items in. This prevents players from using crafting stations as general storage.

### `config.versionCheck`

When enabled, the resource will check for updates on start and notify the server console if a newer version is available.

## Localization

Locale files are stored in the `locales/` folder. The default locale is `en.json`.
