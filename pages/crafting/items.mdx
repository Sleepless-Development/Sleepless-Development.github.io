# Items Setup

To use the crafting system, you need to register the required items in your inventory system. This includes the crafting bench placement items, upgrade items, and any materials/recipes you've configured.

## Default Items

The resource includes example item definitions in `setup_inv_items.lua` for reference. You'll need to add these items to your inventory system.

<Tabs items={['ox_inventory', 'qb-inventory']}>
<Tab>
## ox_inventory Items

Add these items to your `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` file:

### Crafting Bench

```lua
['crafting_bench'] = {
    label = 'Crafting Bench',
    consume = 0,
    weight = 100,
    stack = false,
    close = false,
    client = {
        export = "sleepless_crafting.placeCraftStation",
    }
},
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `client.export` property automatically calls the placement function when the item is used. This is required for placing crafting stations.
</Callout>

### Upgrade Items

```lua
['bench_upgrade_2'] = {
    label = 'Crafting Bench Upgrade Tier 2',
    weight = 50,
    stack = false,
    close = false,
},

['bench_upgrade_3'] = {
    label = 'Crafting Bench Upgrade Tier 3',
    weight = 75,
    stack = false,
    close = false,
},

['bench_upgrade_4'] = {
    label = 'Crafting Bench Upgrade Tier 4',
    weight = 100,
    stack = false,
    close = false,
},
```

</Tab>
<Tab>
## qb-inventory Items

Add these items to your `qb-core/shared/items.lua` file:

### Crafting Bench

```lua
crafting_bench = {
    name = 'crafting_bench',
    label = 'Crafting Bench',
    weight = 100,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'crafting_bench.png',
    unique = true,
    useable = true,
    shouldClose = true,
    description = 'A Useable Crafting Bench'
},
```

<Callout type="warning">
  For QB-Core, you'll also need to add a useable item handler in your server scripts to trigger the placement function.
</Callout>

### Upgrade Items

```lua
bench_upgrade_2 = {
    name = 'bench_upgrade_2',
    label = 'Crafting Bench Upgrade Tier 2',
    weight = 50,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'bench_upgrade_2.png',
    unique = false,
    useable = false,
    shouldClose = false,
    description = 'Upgrade your crafting bench to tier 2.'
},

bench_upgrade_3 = {
    name = 'bench_upgrade_3',
    label = 'Crafting Bench Upgrade Tier 3',
    weight = 75,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'bench_upgrade_3.png',
    unique = false,
    useable = false,
    shouldClose = false,
    description = 'Upgrade your crafting bench to tier 3.'
},

bench_upgrade_4 = {
    name = 'bench_upgrade_4',
    label = 'Crafting Bench Upgrade Tier 4',
    weight = 100,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'bench_upgrade_4.png',
    unique = false,
    useable = false,
    shouldClose = false,
    description = 'Upgrade your crafting bench to tier 4.'
},
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Custom Station Types

If you create additional station types in `stationTypes.lua`, you'll need to create corresponding items for each one.

For example, if you add a `cooking` station type:

```lua
["cooking"] = {
    placeItem = 'cooking_station',
    -- ... rest of config
}
```

You'll need to add the `cooking_station` item:

<Tabs items={['ox_inventory', 'qb-inventory']}>
<Tab>
```lua
['cooking_station'] = {
    label = 'Cooking Station',
    consume = 0,
    weight = 150,
    stack = false,
    close = false,
    client = {
        export = "sleepless_crafting.placeCraftStation",
    }
},
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```lua
cooking_station = {
    name = 'cooking_station',
    label = 'Cooking Station',
    weight = 150,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'cooking_station.png',
    unique = true,
    useable = true,
    shouldClose = true,
    description = 'A portable cooking station'
},
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Recipe Materials

Don't forget to also register all the materials and output items used in your recipes. For example, if your recipe requires `scrapcloth` and `vodka` to craft a `bandage`:

<Tabs items={['ox_inventory', 'qb-inventory']}>
<Tab>
```lua
['scrapcloth'] = {
    label = 'Scrap Cloth',
    weight = 10,
},

['vodka'] = {
    label = 'Vodka',
    weight = 50,
},

['bandage'] = {
    label = 'Bandage',
    weight = 20,
},
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```lua
scrapcloth = {
    name = 'scrapcloth',
    label = 'Scrap Cloth',
    weight = 10,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'scrapcloth.png',
    unique = false,
    useable = false,
    shouldClose = false,
    description = 'A piece of scrap cloth'
},

vodka = {
    name = 'vodka',
    label = 'Vodka',
    weight = 50,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'vodka.png',
    unique = false,
    useable = true,
    shouldClose = true,
    description = 'A bottle of vodka'
},

bandage = {
    name = 'bandage',
    label = 'Bandage',
    weight = 20,
    type = 'item',
    image = 'bandage.png',
    unique = false,
    useable = true,
    shouldClose = true,
    description = 'A bandage for treating wounds'
},
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Item Images

You'll need to add images for your items to your inventory's image folder:

- **ox_inventory**: `ox_inventory/web/images/`
- **qb-inventory**: `qb-inventory/html/images/`

<Callout type="tip">
  For best results, use PNG images with a transparent background. The recommended size is 100x100 pixels.
</Callout>
