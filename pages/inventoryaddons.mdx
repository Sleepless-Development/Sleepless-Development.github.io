# Sleepless Inventory Addons

Addon Modules for ox_inventory to enhance the utility with back items, drag crafting, and item carrying systems.

<ResourceLinks repo="https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_inventory_addons" />

## Features

- **Back Items**: Attach items to player models with customizable bone positions and rotations
- **Drag Craft**: Simple crafting system using ox_inventory drag-and-drop mechanics
- **Item Carry**: Automatic item carrying with animations and prop attachments

## Installation

### Download a [release](https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_inventory_addons/releases) or build the source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sleepless-Development/sleepless_inventory_addons.git
```

## Usage

Add the desired addon resources to your `resources` folder and ensure them in your `server.cfg`:

```cfg
ensure ox_inventory
ensure sleepless_inventory_addons
```

Each addon can be configured independently in their respective `config.lua` files.

## Addons Overview

### Back Items
Configure item attachments to player models with bone-specific positioning. Supports weapons, backpacks, and custom items with priority-based slot management.

### Drag Craft
Create crafting recipes that work with ox_inventory's drag-and-drop system. Supports multi-item recipes, durability costs, and client/server-side callbacks.

### Item Carry
Automatically attach props and play animations when players receive specific items. Includes vehicle blocking and walk-only options for realistic item carrying.

## Configuration

Each addon has its own configuration file:

### Back Items (`backitems/config.lua`)
```lua
Config.defaultSlots = {
    ['back'] = {
        { bone = 24818, pos = vec3(0.09, -0.16, 0.12), rot = vec3(0.0, 180.0, 0.0) },
    }
}

Config.BackItems = {
    ['weapon_rifle'] = {
        prio = 1,
        group = 'back',
    }
}
```

### Drag Craft (`dragcraft/config.lua`)
```lua
RECIPES = {
    ['garbage scrapmetal'] = {
        duration = 2000,
        costs = {
            ['garbage'] = {need = 1, remove = true},
            ['scrapmetal'] = {need = 0.1, remove = true},
        },
        result = {
            {name = 'lockpick', amount = 1},
        },
    }
}
```

### Item Carry (`itemcarry/config.lua`)
```lua
local config = {
    ['box'] = {
        walkOnly = true,
        blockVehicle = true,
        anim = {
            dict = 'anim@heists@box_carry@',
            clip = 'idle',
            flag = 51
        },
        prop = {
            bone = 60309,
            model = joaat('hei_prop_heist_box'),
            placement = {
                pos = vec3(0.025000, 0.080000, 0.255000),
                rot = vec3(-145.000000, 290.000000, 0.000000),
            },
        },
    }
}
